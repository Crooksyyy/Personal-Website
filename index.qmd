I am a fourth year student at the University of Toronto. I am majoring in economics with a focus in data analytics, double minor in statistics and political science. I am also completing the certificate in business fundamental offered by the the Rotman School of Management as a part of my degree.

I am currently the cash manager at Sporting Life Sherway Gardens congruently well completing my degree. My tenure at Sporting Life has been marked by a progression through key roles, ultimately culminating in my position as Cash Department Manager. In this capacity, I oversee the intricacies of daily cash management, ensuring a meticulous approach to reconciliation, deposit handling, and adherence to loss prevention protocols.

As a Cash Team Lead, I demonstrated a comprehensive skill set, seamlessly navigating the responsibilities of the cash office while concurrently engaging with customers to provide excellent customer service. This dual-role underscored my versatility and commitment to maintaining operational excellence. Previously I was also a service shop tech, e-commerce associate and sales associate.
